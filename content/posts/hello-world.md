## The test
A simple test message to get stuff going. This should appear in H2 and rest of the blog should work seamlessly. It should be possible to format the content similar to MD and for things to just work. Let us see if that works over a period of time.

For now working with Archie theme, added as hugo module vs adding a git submodule. Both are very interesting approaches

The automatic push trigger should work and this site should be seamlessly updated.
